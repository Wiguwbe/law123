/**
 * The contact resolution routine. One resolver instance
 * can be shared for the whole simulation, as long as you need
 * roughly the same parameters each time (which is normal).
 * 
 * @section algorithm Resolution Algorithm
 * 
 *          The resolver uses an iterative satisfaction algorithm; it loops
 *          through each contact and tries to resolve it. Each contact is
 *          resolved locally, which may in turn put other contacts in a worse
 *          position. The algorithm then revisits other contacts and repeats
 *          the process up to a specified iteration limit. It can be proved
 *          that given enough iterations, the simulation will get to the
 *          correct result. As with all approaches, numerical stability can
 *          cause problems that make a correct resolution impossible.
 * 
 * @subsection strengths Strengths
 * 
 *             This algorithm is very fast, much faster than other physics
 *             approaches. Even using many more iterations than there are
 *             contacts, it will be faster than global approaches.
 * 
 *             Many global algorithms are unstable under high friction, this
 *             approach is very robust indeed for high friction and low
 *             restitution values.
 * 
 *             The algorithm produces visually believable behaviour. Tradeoffs
 *             have been made to err on the side of visual doubleism rather than
 *             computational expense or numerical accuracy.
 * 
 * @subsection weaknesses Weaknesses
 * 
 *             The algorithm does not cope well with situations with many
 *             inter-related contacts: stacked boxes, for example. In this
 *             case the simulation may appear to jiggle slightly, which often
 *             dislodges a box from the stack, allowing it to collapse.
 * 
 *             Another issue with the resolution mechanism is that resolving
 *             one contact may make another contact move sideways against
 *             friction, because each contact is handled independently, this
 *             friction is not taken into account. If one object is pushing
 *             against another, the pushed object may move across its support
 *             without friction, even though friction is set between those bodies.
 * 
 *             In general this resolver is not suitable for stacks of bodies,
 *             but is perfect for handling impact, explosive, and flat resting
 *             situations.
